# IT-Networking-DHCP-VLAN-Telephony

## Description
This project demonstrates a complete network topology setup using:
- **1 Router**
- **2 Switches**
- **Multiple PCs**
- **IP Phones**

The configuration includes **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**, **Voice and Data VLANs**, and **Telephony (VoIP)** services. Designed and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, this setup is ideal for learning enterprise-level network segmentation and IP voice communication.

---

## Project Objectives
- Configure DHCP for dynamic IP assignment to all devices.
- Create and assign VLANs for separating voice and data traffic.
- Enable basic VoIP communication using IP Phones and telephony services.
- Practice router and switch CLI configuration.

## Project Contents


---

## Tools Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** – for simulation and design
- **Text Editor** – for writing and reviewing CLI configs

---

## How to Use
1. Open the `.pkt` file using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Load the CLI configuration files if needed.
3. Observe the IP addressing via DHCP and VLAN separation.
4. Test communication via IP Phones across the network.
